# 🔐 Functional Cybersecurity Requirements & Specifications Baseline

Welcome to the Functional Cybersecurity Requirements and Specifications Baseline repository

This repository is a compendium of cybersecurity requirements and specifications that I have collected, curated, and developed throughout my career as a Product Security Architect. It is meant to serve as a practical and adaptable foundation for embedding security into systems from the ground up


## 📘 Purpose

This repository aims to provide developers, architects, and security professionals with:

A baseline of well-structured functional security requirements
Supporting specifications and design guidance (when applicable)
Testing tips to validate proper implementation
The rationale behind each requirement to clarify intent and value


## ⚠️ Please Note

Not all requirements in this repository will be directly applicable to every system

Security is highly context-dependent. You are encouraged to adapt or extend these requirements to fit the nature, architecture, and threat model of your own application or platform


## 📂 Structure of Each Requirement

Each requirement entry includes the following:

- Rationale: Explains the purpose and intent of the requirement
- Specification (if applicable): Technical criteria, design expectations, or implementation notes
- Testing Tips: Ideas or methods to validate that the requirement is being met


## 📌 Getting Started
